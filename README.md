# CS3223 Database System Implementation Project
**AY20-21 Semester 2**  
**National University of Singapore, School of Computing**

This project aims to let us gain a feel for how query processing works in a “real” system, specifically focusing on a simple SPJ (Select-Project-Join) query engine.  

We saw how different query execution trees have different performance results, which motivates us to query optimization.  

This simple query processing system uses “toy” data sets and an execution system that ignores many of the complex aspects of a real system.

2. External Sort-Merge algorithm (see code at: [insert file name](https://github.com/CS3223-Team-X/CS3223))
3. Sort Merge Join (see code at: [insert file name](https://github.com/CS3223-Team-X/CS3223))
4. Distinct (see code at: [Distinct.java](https://github.com/CS3223-Team-X/CS3223))
5. Orderby (see code at: [insert file name](https://github.com/CS3223-Team-X/CS3223))
